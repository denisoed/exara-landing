# Active Context: Exara

## Current Focus
The project is currently focused on the landing page for Exara, which serves as the primary marketing and information site for the browser extension. The landing page needs to effectively communicate the value proposition, features, and benefits of the extension to potential users.

## Recent Changes
- Landing page HTML structure has been implemented 
- Basic styling with CSS has been applied
- Core UI components have been established
- Key sections are in place (hero, features, pain points, solutions, etc.)
- Docker configuration added for production deployment with Nginx
- Fixed SVG file access issues in Docker setup
- Added docker-compose.yml for easier container management

## Current Status
The landing page is in development with primary structure in place. The site includes:
- Header with navigation
- Hero section with main value proposition
- Pain points section highlighting user problems
- Solution section describing how Exara solves these problems
- Features section detailing key functionality
- Additional sections for use cases, testimonials, pricing, and FAQ
- Docker setup for production deployment with Nginx serving static files
- SVG file handling properly configured

## Active Decisions
1. **Visual Design**: Finalizing visual elements, imagery, and animations
2. **Content Refinement**: Polishing copy and messaging for clarity and impact
3. **Responsive Implementation**: Ensuring proper display across all device sizes
4. **Call-to-Action Optimization**: Maximizing conversion for extension installation
5. **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring fast load times and smooth interactions
6. **Deployment Strategy**: Using Docker with Nginx for production environment
7. **Asset Management**: Proper handling of SVG and other static files

## Next Steps
